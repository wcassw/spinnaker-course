== Restrict Execution

=== Execution Windows

* Execution windows allow you to restrict the times of the day or week when deployments can happen.
* By using execution windows, you can ensure that deployments don’t interfere with times where your service is at peak demand.
* You can also use execution windows to make sure that there is always someone in the office ready to manually intervene or rollback your pipeline.
