== Installing Spinnaker

* We can install and setup Spinnaker.
* If you want to evaluate it, you can use the Quickstart

=== What you will need

* A Machine to Install Halyard
** This can be a local machine, VM, or Docker Container
** A Kubernetes Cluster on which to install Spinnaker itself

=== Install Halyard

==== Overview

* Halyard is a command-line administration tool that manages the lifecycle of your Spinnaker deployment
* Including 
** Writing & validating your deployment’s configuration
** Deploying each of Spinnaker’s microservices,
** Updating the deployment.


=== Running in google cloud:

download the google cloud sdk

*RECOMMENDED* All production-capable deployments of Spinnaker require Halyard in order to install, configure, and update Spinnaker.

==== Instructions

=== Choose a Cloud Provider

==== Amazon

===== Overview
* There are two types of Accounts in the Spinnaker AWS provider; however
* The distinction is not made in how they are configured using Halyard,
* but instead how they are configured in AWS.

* Managing accounts 
** There is always exactly one managing account
** Account is what Spinnaker authenticates as, 
** If necessary, assumes roles in the managed accounts.

* Managed accounts. 
** Every account that you want to modify resources in is a managed account.
** These will be configured to grant AssumeRole access to the managed account.
** This includes the managing account!

==== Which Amazon Cloud?

* Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) 
** Manage EC2 Instances via Spinnaker
** Simply a remote machine
* Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS)
** Elastic Container Service
** Logical Grouping of EC2 instances
** Technically speaking ECS is a mere configuration for an efficient use and management of your EC2 instance(s) resources
** Use this option, if you want to manage containers in Amazon ECS
* Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) - 
** EKS- Managed Kubernetes Service
** Manage containers in Amazon EKS. 
** This option uses Kubernetes V2 (manifest based) Clouddriver
