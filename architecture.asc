=== Debugging

* Each Java service can be configured to listen for a debugger. 
* To start the JVM in debug mode, set the Java system property `DEBUG=true`
* The JVM will then listen for a debugger to be attached on a port specific to that service. 
* The service-specific debug ports are as follows:
