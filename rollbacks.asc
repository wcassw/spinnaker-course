== Rollbacks

=== Automatic Rollbacks

* Having manifests is optimal, IaC
* Rollbacks though are necessary when things go wrong

=== Viewing the Rollbacks

* When using a Kubernetes `Deployment`, history of rollouts is in the `Clusters` tab of your Application
* Spinnaker exposes “Undo Rollout” functionality in two places:
** Clusters tab
** Pipeline stage

=== Ad Hoc Rollbacks

* In cases where you see something is immediately wrong and isolated to a resource in the “Clusters” tab
* You can select “Undo Rollout” from the “Actions” dropdown
* This provides an opportunity to select a healthier alternative

=== Automated Rollbacks

* You can also configure automated rollbacks inside of Spinnaker pipelines.
* These stages are best configured to run when other stages or branches fail, indicating that something has gone wrong in your rollout.
* Number of Revisions Back:
** Counts how many revisions the current active revision should be rolled back by. If you have the following state:

[source, subs="attributes,quotes,verbatim"]
----
nginx-deployment-2d8178b77 (Revision 5) # active
nginx-deployment-7bdd110f7 (Revision 4) 
nginx-deployment-0b13cc8c1 (Revision 1) 
----

And roll back by `“1”` revision, `(Revision 4)` will be active again. Roll back by `“2”` revisions and `(Revision 1)` will be active again.

Keep in mind that Kubernetes will implicitly roll-forward the old configuration, creating `(Revision 6)` in both cases.

=== Parameterized Rollbacks

* Parameterize the target resource to roll back
* Reference anything via pipeline expressions
* Point to something specified using pipeline parameters, for example:
** Upstream deploy stage
** Another stage’s outputs
** Using pipeline expressions.

=== Versioning Artifacts

* Rolling Back will not work unless artifacts are versioned, this includes:
** Docker images
** `ConfigMap`
** Kubernetes Secrets
