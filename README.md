# Working-with-Spinnaker

## Requirements

Install the following:
* npm
* asciidoctor
* asciidoctor-revealjs
* decktape

## Setup Documentation

To Create Documentation, `cd` into this directory

```sh
$ npm init
$ npm install reveal.js
$ chmod +x ./setup-docs.sh
$ ./setup-docs.sh
```

## Add/Change Evaluation Links to the Pages Before Class

DI will provide before the class any links for checking in, pre-class and post-class evaluations, be sure to add those into the slides so that you do not forget.

## Spinnaker Setup Documentation

Open _setup.html_, after running the previous steps to view information how to setup Spinnaker for your class on AWS

## The Application

This repository is **_Just for the documentation_**. For the exercises, we use https://github.com/dhinojosa/spinnaker-study.  Feel free to create your own fork, just be sure to update the lab book!

What I do is generate the documentation here from this repository and copy all _docs.zip_, _lab_book.zip_, _slides.pdf_, _slides.zip_ to the _spinnaker-study_ repository.
