== Prometheus

=== Prometheus Overview

* Prometheus is just one of the available metrics packages that analyzes data from your microservice
* There are various metrics packages to include in your microservice in a variety of languages
* The metrics are "scraped" by prometheus and aggregated into reports

=== Prometheus Architecture

=== Prometheus Setup in Kubernetes

* There are various utilities to get Prometheus up and running, and documentation is terrible
* One of the easier ones, despite horrible documentation, is the Prometheus Operator on Helm(https://coreos.com/operators/prometheus/docs/latest/user-guides/getting-started.html)

=== Setup for Prometheus

[source, sh, subs="attributes,quotes,verbatim"]
----
helm install <name> stable/prometheus-operator
----

WARNING: Ensure that you are in the right context. For canary testing you would need to be in `staging`

=== Create a Service Monitor

* By default, Prometheus is install in the `default` namespace
* `namespaceSelector` will look for metrics in other `namespaces`
* This `ServiceMonitor` needs to be deployed in the `default` namespace

apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: ServiceMonitor
metadata:
  labels:
    release: lasertag
  name: teama-microservice-service-monitor
spec:
  endpoints:
    - interval: 30s
      path: /metrics

  namespaceSelector:
    matchNames:
      - microservices

=== Create a `NodePort` or `LoadBalancer`

Once established, deploy a `NodePort` or `LoadBalancer`

[source, sh, subs="attributes,quotes,verbatim"]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: prometheus
spec:
  type: (NodePort | LoadBalancer)
  ports:
  - name: web
    nodePort: 30900
    port: 9090
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: web
  selector:
    app: prometheus
----

WARNING: Choose `NodePort` or `LoadBalancer`,  `(NodePort | LoadBalancer)` is not a valid option
