== Lab: Using Expressions

=== Overview

* In this lab we will be using expressions to handle what to do with manual judgments

=== Remove the Trigger in "ToProd"

* Remove the trigger in the "ToProd" pipeline
* We will do it elsewhere

=== Change your "Manual Approval"

* In the previous lab, you possibly created a "Manual Approval" stage
* In that stage, let us customize our approval with the following options
** _Approve_
** _Disapprove_

=== Deleting Manifest if Unapproved

* We will be creating a fork based on the our decision to approve or disapprove

* First create a stage _off of the_ Manual Judgment phase
* Select *Delete (Manifest)*
* Ensure that it depends on *Manual Judgment*
* For *Account* ensure that we are doing this in _eks-stage_
* In *Namespace* ensure that it is _microservices_
* For *Selector*, select *Choose Static Target*
* For *Kind* select _deployment_
* For *Name* select your service that you deployed in the last lab

=== Delete Manifest should run on condition

* In the section *Execution Options*, check *Conditional on Expression*
* Enter the following formula: `${#judgment('Manual Judgment').equals('Disapprove')}`
* Save changes to this stage

=== Run Pipeline

* Now the second tine of our fork, this time on what to do with approval

* First create a stage _off of the_ Manual Judgment phase
* Select *Pipeline*
* In *Application* select your `microservice`
* In *Pipeline* select *ToProd*
* In the section *Execution Options*, check *Conditional on Expression*
* Enter the following formula: `${#judgment('Manual Judgment').equals('Approve')}`
* Save changes to this stage

=== Run it to win it!

* Run your pipeline, either manually, or commit a change
* Try both approval and disapproval
* One thing to note, notice in the *Infrastructure* tab that there is nothing in `eks-stage` if you select _Disapprove_

=== Discover your space

* Notice there is another stage called "Check Precondition" that you can use to allow or disallow further stages to run
* What ideas do you have that can be used with expression?
