== Pipeline Templates

Managed pipeline templates are a way to scalably manage pipelines across different teams.

Pipeline templates have two main components:

* Template 
** A pipeline template defines a parameterized pipeline, with the set of variables for which your users will provide values
* Configuration
** A *concrete implementation* of a template. 
** Configurations can inject new stages into the final pipeline graph and inherit or override, or both, triggers, notifications, and parameters.
