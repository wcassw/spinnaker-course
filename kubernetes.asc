=== 3-tier Architecture

=== Review of Resources

=== Pod

* Group of one or more containers (such as Docker containers)
* Shared storage/network
* Specification for how to run the containers

=== Service

* Service is an abstraction which defines a logical set of Pods and a policy by which to access them
* Sometimes this pattern is called a micro-service). 
* The set of Pods targeted by a Service is usually determined by a selector

=== Deployment

* Provides declarative updates for Pods and ReplicaSets.
* Describe a desired state in a Deployment
* Deployment Controller changes the actual state to the desired state at a controlled rate. 
* You can define Deployments to create new ReplicaSets,
* Or remove existing Deployments and adopt all their resources with new Deployment

=== ConfigMap

* Bind to your Pods' containers and system components at runtime
** Configuration files
** Command-line arguments
** Environment variables
** Port numbers
** Other configuration artifacts
* Enable you to separate your configurations from your Pods and components, making workloads portable.

=== ServiceAccount

* Service accounts are users managed by the Kubernetes API. 
* They are bound to specific namespaces, and created automatically by the API server or manually through API calls.
* Service accounts are tied to a set of credentials stored as Secrets

=== Ingress

* Object defines rules for routing HTTP(S) traffic to applications running in a cluster. 
* An Ingress object is associated with one or more Service objects
* Each Service is associated with a set of Pods
